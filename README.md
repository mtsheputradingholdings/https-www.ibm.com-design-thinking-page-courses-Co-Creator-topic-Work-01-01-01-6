ENTERPRISE DESIGN THINKING
# If research is the discipline of understanding the world, design is the discipline of shaping it. 
# While research asks “what is?” design asks “what should be?” Design problems are problems with no predetermined solution. 
# They are questions with no right answer. They require us to make decisions about an uncertain future.
